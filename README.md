# Dynamic Display
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem with current scenario is that we used to have lots of Displays in transport and in public places but we cannot control    them together. Either they are hard coded or run on bulky GSM modules or required a manual re-programming.

## LITERATURE SURVEY:
  1. GSM wireless communication system: we can connect without internet however communication consumes cost.
  2. SMART NOTICE BOARD: Quick communication however only one notice shows at a time.
  3. A Protocol for End-to-End Secure Transmission of SMS: Transmission Protocols however speed of transmission of notices depends on network.
  4. Transmission Policies for Multi-Segment Short Message: Shows working of SMS however limited characters should be accepted while transmitting SMS.
  
## What's New?
  - Multiple display connectivity
  - World wide accessibility
  - wireless connectivity
  - Real Time operation
  - cost efficient
  - voice and text command operation
  - brightness and speed modulation
 
## Components
  - Raspberry Pi 3b
  - max 7219 led matrix module
  - connecting wires

## Libraries
  - MAX7219.led (for interfacing with led matrix)
  - Firebase (for real time data base)

## Application instance
MIT APP Inventor2 is a gui based application developing environment. I'm using this web application to make project application where i can control the led matix usind text message or voice control.
