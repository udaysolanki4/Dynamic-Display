# Dynamic Display

  1.GSM wireless communication system: we can connect without internet however communication consumes cost.
  2.SMART NOTICE BOARD: Quick communication however only one notice shows at a time.
  3.A Protocol for End-to-End Secure Transmission of SMS: Transmission Protocols however speed of transmission of notices depends on network.
  4.Transmission Policies for Multi-Segment Short Message: Shows working of SMS however limited characters should be accepted while transmitting SMS.
